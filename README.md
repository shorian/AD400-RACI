# Creating and Analyzing a RACI Chart

Since "planning a significant personal event like a move or trip" was a recommended type of project for this assignment, I chose to create a chart for my upcoming move. I currently live with one roommate and we will be going our separate ways, completing the bulk of the move on August 3rd.

## Analysis

- **Gaps:** I am exclusively responsible+accountable for many tasks in this project. I found very little discussion of how to notate this in a RACI chart - most guides seem to assume that every task would have at least one responsible party distinct from the accountable party. In the first draft, I marked myself as "A+R". In the second draft, I changed these to "A" only. I'm not sure which is preferable.
- **Overlaps:** I think I was pretty sparing in assigning responsibilities - I don't think the tasks with multiple roles marked "R" are confusing.
- **Balance:** In my opinion, I have too much to do, but it's my move, so it can't be helped.
- **Consultation:** It's arguable that some of the C's in the "Moving Day" section could be changed to I's. In practice, there isn't a sharp distinction between the two; it's a pretty informal thing. I changed a few to I in the second draft.
- **Information Flow:** Some parts of this move are essentially a solo project, so there is very little information flow in those sections.

Other notes:

- I tried including my cosigner and landlords, as they are C's or I's for a couple tasks, but I decided this made the chart harder to parse for no real benefit.
- "Clean old apartment" was removed - our lease specifies a non-refundable cleaning fee. "Repair holes in walls" was added, as I made quite a few of those.

## Creating the Chart in Confluence

Since I had already created an Atlassian account, I figured I might as well create the RACI chart within Confluence. These are the steps I followed:

- I created a new page, added  Add title and text section listing roles and people with each role.
- I clicked "New table," and created a table with 5 columns.
- I mashed the Ctrl+Alt+â†“ hotkey as needed to add rows for all tasks.
- After filling out the names of roles and tasks, I assigned R/A/C/I letters as appropriate.
- I arranged tasks into phases, then added a new row above each phase. In each of those rows, I merged all cells, added a background color, and identified the phase. Confluence's default color scale worked out well for this.
- This project isn't associated with a formal charter, but it might be useful to include this chart in our "Move-out Coordination" document to ensure my roommate and I are on the same page about what needs to be done and who's doing it. While I probably won't be sharing the chart with my helpers directly, I will be communicating substantially the same information on moving day or a few days prior.
- In a more formal project, it's useful to include a RACI chart in the **project charter** to clarify which roles are responsible for which tasks, and who they need to keep in the loop. The RACI chart would also be useful in the **project kickoff meeting** as a quick, visual means of communicating exactly what each team member will be doing. The kickoff meeting is also a great opportunity to revise the chart based on team feedback.
